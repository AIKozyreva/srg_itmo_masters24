We will analyse the AT2G28210 (ACA2) gene, which is alpha carbonic anhydrase 2 coding. Other names aare: alpha carbonic anhydrase 2, ATACA2, T3B23.12, T3B23_12.

Information about gene was found in ensembl.plants 
Gene page is: https://plants.ensembl.org/Arabidopsis_thaliana/Gene/Summary?g=AT2G28210;r=2:12029666-12033096;t=AT2G28210.1;db=core 

Throuh this page we will find out placement of this gene in ref genome. It is on the 2 chromosome. `Chromosome 2: 12,029,666-12,033,096 forward strand.`
Nice, we also can see it on the screenshot below.

Okay, that means i can extract from the reference assembly only Chr 2 data, align my assembly on this ref Chr 2, only for aligned data perform more accurate analysis. (because i don't want to parse such large gff as the whole ref gff, whatfor??)
